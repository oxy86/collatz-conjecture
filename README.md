This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project to demonstrate the Collatz Conjecture (3N+1).

Also known as the Ulam Conjecture, Kakutani's Problem, Syracuse Problem or simply 3N+1, the Collatz Conjecture states:

- Take any positive integer number.
- If the number is odd, multiply it by three and add one. If the number is even, divide by two. Repeat with every new number.

The conjecture →

Every positive integer, if you apply these rules, will end up in a four → two → one loop. 

It is called Collatz Conjecture after German mathematician Luther Collatz.
